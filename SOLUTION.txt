This challenge is a textbook length extension attack inspired by the Flickr API 
debacle (https://vnhacker.blogspot.com/2009/09/flickrs-api-signature-forgery.html) and the

participants start with a valid message and its Message Authentication Code (MAC).
Examination of the source code shows that it computes the mac with RIPEMD-160(secret_key||message).
